## Module 1: Formulations

### Linear Programs

A mathematical program that is not an LP.

- Dividing by variables is not allowed. 
  $$
  \bold{-1/x_1} - x_3
  $$
  
- Cannot have strict inequalities.

- Must have finite number of constraints.

### Integer Program

An integer program is a **linear program** with **added integrality constraints** for some/all of the variables.
$$
max:\ x_1 + x_2 +2x_4 \\
s.t.\ \ \ x1+x2\leq 1 \\
-x_2 - x_3 \geq -1 \\
x_1 + x_3 = 1 \\
\ \ x_1, x_2, x_3 \geq 0 \\
\quad \bold{x1, x3 \ integer.}
$$
Note LPs are easy to solve, IPs are not.
